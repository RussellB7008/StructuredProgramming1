>>> from datetime import date
>>> date1 = date(2014, 7, 2)
>>> date2 = date(2014, 7, 11)
>>> difference = date2 - date1
>>> print(difference.days, "days")
9 days
>>> # This program utilizes the datetime module
>>> # Did not mean to press enter on the line above. Whoops
>>> # This program utilizes the dateime module's date() function, which accepts 3 arguments, year, month, and day. By inputting 2 dates and subtracting the     smaller one from the larger one, then printing the difference with "days" behindit, we receive the expected output.
