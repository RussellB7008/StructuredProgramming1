>>> file_name = input("Input filename here:")
Input filename here: abc.java
>>> file_extension = file_name.split(".")
>>> print("The file extension is " + repr(file_extension[-1]))
The file extension is 'java'
>>> # This program takes an input of a filename and splits it where it finds a ".", which in this case is between   "abc" and "java". It then uses repr() to print the value assigned to file_extension. At this point, file_extension  is already split into a list, so by typing [-1] it will print the string "java" as that is in the last index of the list it has created.
