>>> color_list = ["Red", "Green", "White", "Black"]

	return sample_list[0] + " and " + sample_list[-1]

>>> first_and_last(color_list)
'Red and Black'
>>> # This function works not only for color_list, but for any list because of how it is written. When asked to     print index 0 of a list(return sample_list[0]), Python will print the very first item in the list. This prints out  "Red" in this case. Given a negative index, Python will count from the end of the list, and as -0 is unreal, -1 will return the last item on the list, printing "Black" for this list. Adding " and " was my way of making the output     look prettier.
